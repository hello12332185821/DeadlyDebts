# 💰 DeadlyDebts
### The ultimate physical-item bounty system for Minecraft servers.

DeadlyDebts is a high-performance bounty plugin that moves away from virtual currency. Instead of "fake" money, players put real items. Diamonds, Netherite, or custom currency, on the heads of their enemies.

## ✨ Features

* **Physical Loot Bounties:** Use physical items as rewards. What you put in is what the killer gets.
* **Dynamic Previews:** Players can browse active bounties and preview the loot inside a secure GUI.
* **Race-Condition Protection:** Advanced synchronization prevents players from bypassing bounty limits by depositing items simultaneously.
* **Anti-Ghosting Technology:** Custom inventory handling ensures items never get "stuck" or "disappear" due to client-side desync.
* **Admin Tools:** Manage, delete, and monitor all bounties through an intuitive administrative interface.
* **Lightweight & Fast:** Optimized for performance with asynchronous file saving and memory caching.
